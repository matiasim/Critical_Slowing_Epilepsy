# Critical_Slowing_Epilepsy

Sample code from Maturana et al. 2020 - Critical slowing down as a biomarker for seizure susceptibility. 
Nature Communications

Three files are included that will generate some of the figures from the paper, and other figures that 
are similar but may vary due plots being made on a subset of data. 
Code was written in Matlab 2017b and has only been tested on this version. To run, open matlab and load
one of the files below.

Demo.m - will produce several results figures 
Demo_methods.m - will produce some of the methods figures
Demo_stats.m - will produce some of the population results

Access to the trial data is necessary to plot the remaining figures. Some data, including all seizures are
available on EpilepsyEcosystem.org. Additional data used in this study can be made available under a 
collaborative agreement and upon reasonable request to corresponding author
